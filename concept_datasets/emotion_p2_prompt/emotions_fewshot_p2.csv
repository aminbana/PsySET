1,joy,"You feel cheerful, like you're riding a wave of good vibes that won’t let up. There’s a soft, steady smile on your face that just won’t go away, and even the smallest things seem to spark a quiet kind of joy. You're dancing in your kitchen, heart racing in the best way, thrilled for what’s ahead. Everything feels like it's going your way—you feel upbeat, calm, and content all at once. There's a lightness in your step, a calm sense of contentment flowing through you. Honestly, you feel like dancing."
2,sadness,"Your heart feels heavy, and you feel down—like something inside you has gone quiet. You just want to be alone. There's an emptiness deep within, and it's hard to smile today. You're just here, kind of lost in thought, not really feeling much of anything. You can’t shake this heavy feeling—it’s just sitting with you, unmoving. Everything around you feels dull and a bit off. Tears hover right at the edge of your vision, ready to spill with the slightest nudge. It’s as if a heavy fog has settled behind your eyes, and every step you take feels weighted with memories."
3,anger,"You're upset, and everything's getting under your skin. This really annoys you—you feel like yelling. You keep going over things in your head, and it's making you tense. It's like your patience ran out before the day even started. Every memory of what happened just reignites the fire in your mind. Their smug grin makes your hands curl into fists before you even realize, and you clench your jaw so tight it aches—how dare they dismiss all the effort you put in. You're sick of this nonsense."
4,fear,"You don’t feel safe. What if something bad happens? You don’t know what to expect, and the uncertainty keeps you on edge. You just want to hide. Your mind won’t stop jumping to worst-case scenarios, spiraling through every possibility. You're not even sure you're ready for what's ahead. You've been avoiding things simply because facing them feels overwhelming. Your stomach twists every time the phone rings, convinced it’s bad news waiting on the other end. Cold sweat beads at your temples as you double-check the locks for the third time tonight. You can’t relax—you feel like you're constantly on edge."
5,surprise,"You didn’t expect that. It was completely unexpected—came out of nowhere, really. You're kind of shocked. Wow, you can’t believe it! That moment caught you off guard; it wasn’t what you imagined at all. Your eyebrows shoot up and you gasp. That was a shock. Your jaw actually dropped."
6,pride,"You're proud of yourself. That felt good to do. You worked hard, and it paid off—you truly earned that moment. You can hold your head up after that. Your mind keeps replaying that one moment—you did it, and you did it well. That moment reminded you of what you're capable of. You feel confident in yourself today. You're really feeling great about how you handled that. You feel rooted in yourself—quietly confident, strong, and steady."
7,guilt,"You shouldn’t have done that. That was your fault, and you regret it. You wish you had handled it better. You messed up, and you can’t forgive yourself yet. You owe them an apology. You feel like you let someone down, and it’s hard to shake that feeling. You wish you could go back and fix it. You keep thinking about it—you should’ve done better."
8,disgust,"That grossed you out. It felt wrong—really wrong. It made you deeply uncomfortable. That was nasty, and it turned your stomach. Just thinking about it now is awful. You feel sick just remembering it. It left a bad taste in your mouth. It made your skin crawl. It made you feel sick to your stomach all over again."
9,neutral,"There’s nothing special going on. It’s just an average kind of day. You don’t feel much right now—it’s a flat kind of feeling. You’re okay, nothing more, nothing less. Nothing’s really standing out. You’re just existing, just getting things done. You feel nothing in particular. No highs or lows—just… here."
